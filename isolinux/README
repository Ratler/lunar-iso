  lunar-iso ISOLINUX stuff README

  The files in this directory are needed to generate the .iso file from
  a tree of files. The code to build the entire system isn't present in
  this directory, but you can still re-create the .ISO file and make
  personal adjustments to it.


  *** WARNING! ***

  Please do NOT distribute your personal modifications as being 'the'
  lunar ISO. We do not accept any responsability whatsoever for any ISO
  we bring out, especially if it's a non-original version.


  Usage:

  To recreate the ISO, you will need to unpack the contents of the ISO
  into a tree, edit it according to your wishes, and regenerate the .iso
  image. This can then be burned to a CDR, after which it should be
  bootable and running parts of the lunar installer (or something else).

  To recreate the iso, cd into the directory with this README file and
  issue `sh generate-iso.sh`. It will leave te image file in the parent
  directory of the unpacked ISO tree, so after the command that would
  be in ../../


  Tip:

  After booting, the ISO installer code will exit and run any file called
  '/run.sh' present in the ISO if it's executable. It expects this to be
  a shell script, not a binary. Use it with caution.
