Loading IDE/SCSI drivers

When you need special modules to install on special IDE hardware or
SCSI cards, you will need to load certain kernel modules before
installing. This will allow you to load a SCSI or IDE driver and
read the installation files from a CD-ROM drive attached to such
a device.

To load these modules, type 02linux07 and load the modules from the initrd
menu. The auto-detection code can attempt to find the required modules
for you automatically, but this might not work.


type 02linux07 followed by optional kernel parameters to use this boot option
