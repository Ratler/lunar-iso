Welcome to Lunar Linux %VERSION% (%CODENAME%)!

Read `man lfirsttime` if you are a new Lunar Linux user. It contains
many hints that are useful if you do not know what to do next.

Also read the unix manual pages for lunar, moonbase, lin and lrm.

Please remember that the ISO is not a fully featured working system,
you should install your favorite tools and packages yourself with `lin`.

You are reading the contents of "/etc/motd", if you don't edit it, it will
continue to bug you with the message above.
