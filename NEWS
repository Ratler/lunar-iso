20081012 1.6.4-beta1 ratler
    * Beta 1 release!

    * Modules
    - Kernel bumped to 2.6.27
    - All packages refreshed
    - freetype2 removed

    * Installer
    - Fixed issue with swap partitions showing up twice in fstab
      if you add more than one
    - Fixed issue with block device list, Bash 3.2 changed behavior 
      in =~ operator, the regex can no longer be quoted
    - Modified a small problem in transfer() where some variables got
      assigned with the wrong values. Also added a feature to list
      what filesystem type you choosed for the assigned partition
    - Disabled the dialog that tell the user to rebuild the kernel for
      xfs, jfs and reiserfs since the kernel now includes them by default
    - More software raid fixes from ElAngelo
    - We now disable /tmp on tmpfs if the user add a /tmp partition
    - Precompiled kernels will now get registered as installed
    - Simplified the language menu. This time the iso process will
      create a file on the iso that contain a language list
    - perl moved from extended.list -> base.list, needed for vim to work
      on the iso
    - As mentioned the default kernel config now compile xfs, jfs and reiserfs
      as builtin

    * Script changes
    - isofs
      - Disable memtest on x86_64 (doesn't build or work anyway)
      - New isolinux templates for x86_64, needed since memtest is gone
    - rebuild
      - Make sure we copy the kernel config for the correct arch to the ISO
    - initrd
      - Fixed lib64 symlink issue, could cause issues with the running system
    - memtest
      - exit 0 if x86_64
    - gen_locale_list
      - New script to generate a language list from the locale-archive in $ISO_TARGET
    

20080914 1.6.4-alpha3 ratler
    * Alpha release 3

    - Fixed issue with packages showing up twice in state/lunar/packages
    - udev should now install fine inside the BUILD chroot
    - Remove bits/syscall.h before lin -c glibc since glibc does a file
      and compare check during make install that decide it's unchanged
      and not installing it
    - scripts/aaa_base: Removed explicit kernel-headers-X.X from packages
      file generation, kernel-headers are already listed in base.list-X.X
    - Auto-generate copyright year for isolinux files
    - Added rootdelay=10 to kernel options for isolinux, let usb settle
      before probing for devices containing the installation
    - Kernel config bumped to 2.6.26.5
    - Initrd:
       - Support booting installation from any media. For example you can
         put syslinux on a usb stick and copy initrd and kernel from the
         iso, and then put the iso it self on the usb-stick and boot away.
         It's also possible to put the .iso in the root of any mountable 
         partition (a script will be available later to bootstrap this)
       - No more udev/rules.d template, instead take rules.d from the installed
         udev and wash them to make them work properly with the initrd
    - Installer:
       - Disable staticly defined mount point in fstab that match a user 
         defined mount point during partition selection (currently only /tmp)
       - Further improvements to the language menu to also include territory 
         for each encoding
       - Detect protected device (won't show up in the partition selection),
         this is the device where the .iso reside for the alternative installation
         method
       - Added initd.disable.list file in conf/ that contain services that should
         be disabled by default
       - Added grub and md fixes from ElAngelo
